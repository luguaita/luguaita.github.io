### Predicting ICU Patient Survival with Supervised Learning: Exploring Decision Trees
In this project, I utilized the power of supervised learning and decision trees, two machine learning techniques, to construct predictive models that can make accurate predictions or classifications based on labeled data. Specifically, I employed decision trees to forecast the survival of patients in an ICU setting

### Using Supervised Learning and Decision Trees to Forecast Diamond Prices
Supervised learning and decision trees are machine learning techniques used to train models that can make predictions or classifications based on labeled data. In this project I built decision trees to predict diamond prices.
