### Analyzing Startup Success: Unveiling Patterns with Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are widely recognized as the predominant machine learning methods for prediction. ANNs and SVMs are specifically designed to analyze and learn patterns from experimental or real data, enabling accurate identification of data behavior. In this project, I focus on analyzing the factors contributing to startup success using these powerful techniques.

### Connecting Airports: A Knowledge Graph Visualization Approach
A knowledge graph consists of nodes (also known as entities) and edges (also known as relationships) that connect those nodes. Each node represents a concept or entity, while the edges represent the relationships between those concepts. In this project, I display airports as nodes and the connections between them as edges, providing a visual representation of how airports are related to each other based on their origin and destination relationships, enabling easier exploration and understanding of the airport network.

### Predicting ICU Patient Survival with Supervised Learning: Exploring Decision Trees
In this project, I utilized the power of supervised learning and decision trees, two machine learning techniques, to construct predictive models that can make accurate predictions or classifications based on labeled data. Specifically, I used decision trees to forecast the survival of patients in an ICU setting.
