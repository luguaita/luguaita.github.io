### Analyzing Startup Success: Unveiling Patterns with Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are widely recognized as the predominant machine learning methods for prediction. ANNs and SVMs are specifically designed to analyze and learn patterns from experimental or real data, enabling accurate identification of data behavior. In this project, I focus on analyzing the factors contributing to startup success using these powerful techniques.

### Predicting ICU Patient Survival with Supervised Learning: Exploring Decision Trees
In this project, I utilized the power of supervised learning and decision trees, two machine learning techniques, to construct predictive models that can make accurate predictions or classifications based on labeled data. Specifically, I used decision trees to forecast the survival of patients in an ICU setting.
